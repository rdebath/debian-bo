Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

 The most popular server in the world, Apache features a modular
 design and supports dynamic loading of extension modules at runtime.
 Some of its strong points are its range of possible customization,
 dynamic adjustment of the number of server processes, and a whole
 range of available modules including many authentication mechanisms,
 server-parsed HTML, server-side includes, access control, CERN httpd
 metafiles emulation, proxy caching, etc. Apache also supports multiple
 virtual homing.
 .
 This release of the Apache server can replace any Apache server already
 installed with any standard module and guesses which modules should
 be loaded by looking at the site configuration files.  Any site-specific
 modules that were previously linked into Apache can then be dynamically
 loaded at startup.

Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) on laptops
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation. APM support has been in the kernel since 1.3.46.
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon that provides logging of the
 battery status, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an
 X11 utility that displays a little graph, (and tailf(1) which follows
 the growth of a log file).
 .
 It requires an 1.3.x kernel and should work with both the old
 (pre-1.3.58) and the new (1.3.58) /proc/apm format. No further
 changes in the /proc/apm format are anticipated.
 .
 Starting with version 2.4 of apmd, --suspend and --standby are supported
 on kernels 1.3.98 or higher.

Description: Apple ][ Emulator
 This is a fully-functional 100% Apple ][ emulator for the Linux console.
 .
 It is partly written in 386 (AT&T) assembler and partly in C. You can
 switch diskettes using a diskette database through an intuitive
 interface.  Furthermore, it is possible to trim the speed of the
 emulator and it runs in full speed (approximately) twice as fast as an
 standard Apple II+ on a 486DX-50.  It uses the svgalib's key scancodes
 and implements the undocumented 6502 instructions (required by at
 least two games: Bug Attack and MS Pacman).
 .
 Because the Apple ROMs are copyrighted, they are not included here.  You
 will have to make copies of them from your old Apple computer.  If you
 don't want to mess around with this, you can find a copy at:
 .
    http://geta.life.uiuc.edu/~badger/files/apple_II.rom
    http://geta.life.uiuc.edu/~badger/files/slot6.rom
 .
 Transferring your old Apple disks is a bit of work, but you can save
 yourself the trouble of digging up your old masters by seeing if kind
 soul has already done the work for you at:
 .
    ftp://ftp.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/
 .
 Remember, you can only use these images _legally_ if you already own
 the original.  Have fun!   (Ahhh....  What memories!)

Description: Binary Editor And Viewer (beav)
 beav is an editor for binary files containing arbitrary
 data.  Text file editors, on the other hand, expect the
 files they edit to contain textual data, and/or to be
 formatted in a certain way (e.g., lines of printable
 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY.  You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode.  You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes.  Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats.  While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering.   Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file.  The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format.  Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 addresses are on which side of the Bridge and forwarding only packets
 that are necessary. Linux will work like an Ethernet Switch!

 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as
 C/C++ programs and/or TeX documentation for them.
 .
 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.

Description: An arbitrary precision reverse-polish calculator.
 Dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports
 unlimited precision arithmetic.  It also allows you to
 define and call macros.  Normally dc reads from the standard
 input; if any command arguments are given to it, they
 are filenames, and dc reads and executes the contents of
 the files before reading from standard input.  All normal
 output is to standard output; all error output is to
 standard error.
 .
 A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.
 Entering a number pushes it on the stack.  Arithmetic
 operations pop arguments off the stack and push the
 results.

Description: The Data Display Debugger, a graphical frontend for GDB.
 The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a comfortable graphical user interface
 to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers.  Besides ``usual'' features such
 as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD provides a *graphical data
 display*, where data structures are displayed as graphs.  Complex data
 structures can be explored incrementally and interactively.
 .
 Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in C, C++,
 Pascal, MODULA-2, FORTRAN, and ADA; machine-level debugging; hypertext
 source navigation and lookup; breakpoint, backtrace, and history editors;
 preferences and settings editors; program execution in terminal emulator
 window; debugging on remote host; on-line manual; interactive help on the
 Motif user interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line interface with full editing,
 history, and completion capabilities.  DDD has been designed to compete with
 well-known commercial debuggers.

 reorganises the data on the disk, so that individual files occupy a
 single sequential set of disk blocks, and all the free space on the
 disk is collected together in a single region.  This generally means
 that reading a whole file is more efficient.

Description: Linux "Debian Distribution" Packages Maintainer
 The purpose of this program is to make it easy to keep your local
 installation of Linux consistent with the Debian distribution
 available on many FTP sites, NFS mounts, or CD-ROM.  It does this by
 comparing the list of installed packages with those available by FTP
 or at a specified directory.  A list of packages, categorized to make
 selection easier, is then presented to the user to choose what to
 install.  All selected packages are then fetched if necessary (using
 FTP), verified for correctness, and then installed.
 .
 Dftp can also be run on a non-Debian machine in the case where the
 Debian machine does not have FTP access.  For this, stand-alone
 versions of dftp, in both "csh" and "perl" source, are available under
 /debian/project/misc.

 the functionality of BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients
 based on lease times. DHCP is used extensively by Microsoft and more
 recently also by Apple. It is probably essential in any multi-platform
 environemnt.
 .
 The current DHCP implementations has limits because it can only
 assign IP addresses based on ONE Ethernet interface. Some changes
 to the kernel need to be made to enable multiple Ethernet Interface
 functionality which I expect will be include in some future 2.1.X Kernel.

Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where

 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 most vanilla ISP set ups.  There is no canned Microsoft(tm) DUN or
 RAS client support, but you can edit the scripts and config files
 created by hand to add it if you wish.  Alternatively, you can read
 the ppp HOWTO docs and can one yourself.  This comes with tutorials
 on chat, ppp, this utlity, and the dialog widgets.  This is designed
 for the newbie to help get ppp set up with minimal effort.  There
 should be canned configurations for Microsoft(tm) RAS & DUN clients
 by the next release (i.e. it will automatically setup a PAP/CHAP

Description: MIME & PGP-aware interactive mail reader [enhanced]
 Elm ME+ is an enhanced version of the Elm mail reader.
 Features you will find in Elm ME+ include: anonymous
 remailer support, chaining, PGP, MIME, MIME type guessing,
 message/rfc822 enhanced support, application/pgp support,
 fully configurable from within the program, delivery status
 notification (in compliance with ESMTP), and more.
 .
 PGP features include: mark on folder menu showing PGP
 encrypted messages and public key blocks, encryption and
 signing of outgoing messages, decryption, signature checking,
 mailing public key blocks, extracting public key blocks
 from messages.  Special feature allows you to have Elm ME+
 keep track of your PGP passphrase so you only need to enter
 it a minimal number of times.
 .
 MIME features include: internal handling of MIME encodings
 and multipart/* messages -- only needs to use metamail
 with a content-type that Elm doesn't understand, access
 to individual portions of MIME multipart message via
 a special menu, "[include" construct when editing message
 as well as a new easy-to-use "Attachments" menu that lets
 you add/modify/delete attachments, mime.types support.
 .
 Elm's interface is interactive, full-screen.  All configuration
 can be done within the program -- no need to edit external files.
 .
 This version of Elm ME+ is officially designated
 "Elm2.4ME+ PL31 (25)" meaning this enhanced version of
 Elm is based upon Elm2.4pl25.  Thus is has all features
 present in Elm2.4pl25 plus its enhanced feature set.

 Elvis adds support for multiple files, multiple windows, a variety
 of display modes, on-line help, and other miscellaneous extensions.
 .
 Elvis has a special hex editing mode for working with binary data.  It
 also provides color syntax highlighting, with syntax modes for c, c++,
 java, awk, makefiles, perl, postscript, pascal, sh, tcl, vrml, html,
 diffs, man pages, and fortran.  If all this isn't enough for you, it is
 easy to add new syntax modes (additions are welcome!).

 and -t option. The "refs" file is sometimes used by the ref(1) program.
 .
 Each C source file is scanned for #define statements and global
 function definitions. The name of the macro or function becomes the
 name of a tag. For each tag, a line is added to the "tags" file
 which contains:
 	- the name of the tag
 	- a tab character
 	- the name of the file containing the tag
 	- a tab character
 	- a way to find the particular line within the file.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.  (Until now, the only
 option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
 PC as a terminal.)  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you
 start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
 everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on how well you
 can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs :-).
 Emacspeak requires one of the following speech synthesizers: DECtalk
 Express, DECtalk MultiVoice, or the software DECtalk on the DEC
 Alpha.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: An alternative to anonymous FTP
 In the words of the developers, FSP is what anonymous FTP should have
 been. Basically, FSP is more robust (an intermittent link doesn't phase
 it one bit) and kinder to slow links (the data transfer rate is
 significantly lower) than FTP; this enables a given server to handle
 requests from many more clients than a corresponding FTP server.
 Furthermore, the FSP clients are all run from the command line, storing
 certain information - such as the current directory - in the environment.
 As a consequence, whilst you are downloading a file, you can also be
 browsing other directories of interest.
 .
 From the clients' point of view, FSP allows the access restrictions to be
 lifted, because of the slower transfer rate. (How many times have you had
 "User anonymous access denied" flash at you?) From the servers' point of
 view, much less strain is placed on the network, and because the server
 never forks, the maximum increase in load is one.
 .
 If you want to learn more about FSP, the FSP FAQ is included in
 /usr/doc/fsp; it can also be accessed from the Web address
 http://itu.rdg.ac.uk/misc/fsp/faq/faq.htm
 .
 Two popular FSP sites are ftp.wustl.edu, port 21, and
 fsp.idsoftware.com, also on port 21. Both of these are identical to their
 corresponding FTP sites.

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 Depending on the UPS, cable, and the manner in which the genpower
 package is configured, the genpower package provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Line power sensing
  * Low battery detection
  * Physical cable detection
  * The ability to kill the UPS's inverter
 .
 The Debian package has an extra cable description called "apc-advanced"
 that should support all of the above for the APC Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,

Description: GNU Forth Language Environment
 This is the GNU'ish implementation of a Forth programming environment.
 .
 Forth, as a language, is best known for being stack-based, and completely
 extensible.  Each Forth environment provides one or more dictionaries of
 pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and
 executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It
 has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about
 writing programs.
 .

Description: The OpenGL Utility Toolkit.
 GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit,
 a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.  It
 implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for
 OpenGL. GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL
 programming.
 .
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs.
 While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
 applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
 requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window
 system toolkits like Motif. GLUT is simple, easy, and small.

 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
 Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
 object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
 notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
 remote object messaging support (distributed objects), event loops, and
 random number generators.
 .
 It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
 portion of the OpenStep standard.  In many cases, the `NS*' classes are
 implemented as wrappers around more featureful GNU classes.

Description: A PostScript and PDF viewer for X using 2d Athena Widgets
 gv is a comfortable viewer of PostScript and PDF files for the
 X Window System. This version uses the standard Athena Widget
 library.
 Some features as e.g. PDF files or anti-aliasing are only
 supported if a recent ghostscript (4.0 or later) is installed.
 .
 It uses the gs PostScript interpreter and is based on the
 classic X front-end for gs, ghostview. It is more comfortable
 and more powerful than ghostview.
 .
 The new gs version (>= 4.0) can view PDF files.
 It is mostly compliant with Adobe's PDF format, so it has less
 problems than xpdf. There is no support for encrypted pdf files.
 It provides much better output than xpdf and even AcroRead (Adobe's
 PDF Reader) but is far slower.

 This package contains the Icon compiler. It generates programs that
 generally run faster than those of the icont/iconx Icon interpreter. On the
 other hand, the Icon compiler takes much longer to compile programs and is
 more memory-hungry than the iconx/icont pair. As such, the compiler is
 probably only useful to speed up the execution of large Icon programs once
 they are fully developed and debugged.

Description: The Inter-Language Unification system
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system. The object interfaces provided by ILU hide
 implementation distinctions between different languages, between
 different address spaces, and between operating system types. ILU can
 be used to build multi-lingual object-oriented libraries ("class
 libraries") with well-specified language-independent interfaces. It
 can also be used to implement distributed systems. It can also be used
 to define and document interfaces between the modules of
 non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces are specified in ILU's
 Interface Specification Language.

Description: remote mail folder access server for Pine and others
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, ie with
 your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
 where all the messages are stored.
 .
 This protocol for remote mail access is supported by Pine and by some
 DOS/Windows and Macintosh MUA's (Mail User Agents).
 .
 If you just want to use Pine to read your email on your Linux system
 you do not need this package.
 .
 If you do install imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.
 .
 You will probably also want to install Pine or some other IMAP client
 so that you can test your IMAP server.

Description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by the ISC and Rich Salz
 INN is Debian's preferred news transport system.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.
 .
 This package will give some troubles if upgrading from inn_1.4unoff4-1.
 Just configure it again and it will work. Do not report this as a bug.

 example, the default kernel does not support some of your hardware, or
 you wish a leaner, meaner kernel.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and
 tk4X-dev and try "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use
 interface. Also, on intel platforms, you may wish to get bin86 (if
 you wish to compile the kernel sources, that is.)

Description: Latex to HTML translator.
 Latex2html is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 Latex2html replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 Latex2html extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a  LaTeX document.

Description: Latent Energy Environment.
 LEE (Latent Energy Environments) is both an Alife model and
 a software tool to be used for simulations within the framework
 of that model.  The modeling of environmental complexity across
 different Alife experiments is perhaps the main motivation behind
 this project.  LEE allows the specification of environments of
 graduated complexity.  A spacially distributed series of
 "atomic elements" must be combined to transform their "latent
 potential energy" into "work" necessary for survival.
 Behavioral strategies must be evolved by the population such
 as to allow an efficient exploitation of the available energy.
 This latent energy can be used to measure the environment
 complexity with respect to the survival task.

Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains user binaries for libgsm, an implementation of the European
 GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long
 term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: Development libraries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains header files and development libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 Applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring,

 different interface for packet capture, and since we've developed
 several tools that require this functionality, we've created this
 system-independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need
 for several system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.

 libtclobjc is a library of Objective-C objects and support functions for
 communicating between Objective-C and Tcl/Tk.  From Tcl you can send
 messages to Objective-C objects and get textual representations of
 what's returned.  Thus it provides a way to interactively type messages
 and see the results, all inside the rich structure of the Tcl scripting
 language--almost an Objective-C interpreter.  The library also provides
 an Objective-C object that will forward all of its messages to the Tcl
 interpreter in textual format.

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.
 .
 GNU `m4' was originally written by Ren'e Seindal, with subsequent
 changes by Franc,ois Pinard and other volunteers on the Internet.  All
 names and email addresses can be found in the file `THANKS' from the
 GNU `m4' distribution.
 .
 This is release 1.4.  It is now to be considered stable, future
 releases are only meant to fix bugs, increase speed, or improve
 documentation.  However...
 .
 An experimental feature, which would improve `m4' usefulness, allows
 for changing the syntax for what is a "word" in `m4'.  You should use:
 ./configure --enable-changeword
 .
 if you want this feature compiled in.  The current implementation slows
 down `m4' considerably and is hardly acceptable.  So, it might go away,
 do not count on it yet. Depends: libc5

Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands.
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 This program performs the decoding of transfer encoded text type
 mime messages.  The message in its entirety is read from stdin.
 The decoded message is written to stdout; hence, this program
 behaves as a filter which may be placed wherever convenient.
 .
 It is assumed that the message has reached its point of final
 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.
  - The charset is assumed to be iso-8859-1
  - part or subparts of content-type text only are decoded
  - all other content-types are passed transparently.

 Nethack is a single-user, fantasy role-playing computer game, a direct
 descendant of the games Hack and Rogue.  Nethack is a -very- complex game,
 compared to ones such as Moria, Rogue, or Angband.  There are several
 different character classes, a larger variety of items (from keys to
 artifacts), a leaner, meaner collection of monsters, and several quests that
 a player must finish before winning the game.  There are also many new
 dungeon features as well as interesting and quite amusing things that a
 player can do.
 .
 Much of the Dungeons of Doom within Nethack is borrowed from several fantasy
 genres, including Tolkien's Middle Earth, King Aurthor, and Dungeons and
 Dragons, as well as a few small references to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and the
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Description: Heavy-duty USENET news reader (curses-based client)
 nn stands for "No News is good news", and the nn newsreader is designed to let
 you minimize the amount of time you spend reading news (or, more
 realistically, to allow you to follow even more newsgroups :-).
 .
 nn allows you to quickly select articles of interest and skip the rest.  It
 also supports efficient article killing and selection of articles by author
 and subject.
 .
 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network News
 Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP server's NOV database, if
 configured.  You must have a news server available - large sites usually
 provide a site-wide server.  (For those familiar with 'nn', this is a
 client-only version.)
 .
 (Having recently used both nn and trn, I think it's a tossup as to which is
 best, as trn seems to include many of nn's best features.  If you're a
 diehard nn user, "trn -x -XX" will start trn in a mode which somewhat
 resembles nn.)

Description: 4.4BSD re-implementation of vi.
 Vi is the original screen based text editor for Unix systems.
 It is considered
 the standard text editor, and is available on almost all Unix systems.
 .
 Nvi is intended as a "bug-for-bug compatible" clone of the original
 BSD vi editor. As such, it doesn't have a lot of snazzy features as do
 some of the other vi clones such as elvis and vim. However, if all
 you want is vi, this is the one to get.

Description: An Objective-C collection class library.
 ObjectPak is a rewrite from scratch of the objects described in Brad
 Cox' book.  ObjectPak is largely compatible in interface with the
 collection classes of Stepstone's ICpak101 (but not with the ICpak101
 foundation classes).  Runtime dependencies are left out of ObjectPak.
 You can therefore work with the same objects on any current or future
 implementation of Objective C, yet take advantage of each particular
 environment.  Classes include string objects, ordered collections of
 objects, sets of objects, dictionaries, key-value tables, sorted sets,
 sequenced sets.

 VAX Pascal, Oregon Software Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's
 Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is
 also supported. Output is a set of .c and .h files
 that comprise an equivalent program in any of several
 dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and
 dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific
 machine and compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are
 converted into fully functional C which will compile and
 run with no further modifications, although p2c sometimes
 chooses to generate readable code at the expense of absolute
 generality.

 speed.

 Although quite an amount of symbolic manipulation is possible in PARI,
 this system does very badly compared to much more sophisticated
 systems like Axiom, Macsyma, Magma, Maple, Mathematica or Reduce on
 such manipulations (e.g. multivariate polynomials, formal integration,
 etc...). On the other hand, the two main advantages of the system
 are its speed (which can be between 5 and 100 times better on many
 computations than the above mentioned systems), and the possibility of
 using directly data types which are familiar to mathematicians.

Description: PCMCIA Card Services for Linux.
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modulues have been compiled.

 .
 Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
 is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
 machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
 variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
 etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

Description: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon.
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to
 transmit datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard
 way for the machines at either end of the link (the "peers")
 to negotiate various optional characteristics of the link.  Using
 PPP, a serial link can be used to transmit Internet Protocol (IP)
 datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections between the peers.
 .
 This ppp implements the following special features (folded in from the
 former isp-ppp package):
 - Remote DNS Server Configuration for Microsoft Clients and compat.
 - Remote WINS Server Configuration for Microsoft Clients amd compat.
 - Bug Fix to accomodate incoming buggy Winsock PPPs (Trumpet Winsock) dialup
 - Logs to LOG_LOCAL2 so that the ppp logs are completely separate.
 .
 Together with mgetty-0.99 this package will allow extremely easy dialup
 configuration for Win95, NT or Win3.11 with IE 3.0. The user simply has
 to type your phone number, username and password and the webbrowser will
 work! No strange IP numbers to configure for the customer.

 This is an experimental release of the procps suite. A lot of features have
 been added since the 1.01(a) release:
 - support for both BSD and POSIX (SVR4) style command line options.
 - completely configurable display of information.
 - colour markup of processes exceeding limits or belonging to special users.
 Please take a look at /usr/doc/procps/NEWS, /usr/doc/procps/changelog.debian and
 the manpages for a concise list. This is how the next upstream release of
 procps may look (i.e. it will  look like this if there is not too much
 resistance).
 This is, for now, a debian-only package which should not appear outside of
 master.debian.org.
 .
 These are utilities to browse the /proc filesystem, which is not a real file
 system but a way for the kernel to provide information about the status of
 entries in its process table. (e.g. running, stopped or "zombie")
 Both command line and full screen utilities are provided. Ncurses is needed
 for the full screen utilities.

 (The most popular nowadays are the HTML DTD's. If you install
 sgml-data, this can turn your emacs into the one of most powerful HTML
 editors and will be ultimately flexible as well, since you could
 upgrade your editor by just installing new DTD's). Functions provided
 includes menus and commands for inserting tags with only the
 contextually valid tags, identification of structural errors, editing
 of attribute values in a separate window with information about types
 and defaults, and structure based editing.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO

 the way two-sided pages are bound).
 .
 The actual tools are psplpr, a printing/filtering tool that manipulates
 a PostScript document to control which features of a PS device will be
 used to print the document, and npslpr, a small command-line compatible
 replacement for pslpr which uses psplpr.

 The user must have access to an account on the sending and on the
 receiving site, too.
 .
 Sendfile for Unix, which is an implementation of the SAFT protocol
 (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) now offers you a true
 asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet.  Virtually any
 form of file can be sent, including encrypted ones.  The SAFT

 An MTA is the innards of the mail system - it takes messages from
 user-friendly mailer programs and arranges for them to be delivered
 locally or passed on to other systems as required.
 .
 In order to make use of it you must have one or more user level
 mailreader programs such as elm, pine, mailx or Emacs (which has Rmail
 and VM as mailreaders) installed.  If you wish to send messages other
 than just to other users of your system you must also have appropriate
 networking support, in the form of IP or UUCP.

Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal
 (EGA-based) textmodes on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like
 configuration file to set up better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution,
 larger font size, higher display refresh...) This is already a big boon on
 normal 14" displays, and it is an immense difference on larger and better
 (15" and up) screens.
 .
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.
 .
 WARNING: This program will not work on non-VGA based systems.  Installing it
 will not do any harm, but activating the program can.

Description: The mother of all X Toolkit clocks.
 Swisswatch is a reimplementation of der Mouse's mclock program using
 lightweight X Toolkit objects ("gadgets").  It relies heavily on
 resources for configuration, and can assume a wide range of looks.
 The application defaults files distributed with swisswatch currently
 support an oclock emulation, a Swiss railway clock emulation, and a
 fancy default appearance.  You are encouraged to play with the
 resources and create your personalized version.

 hosts.
 .
 The klogd daemon listens to kernel message sources and is responsible
 for prioritizing and processing operating system messages.  The klogd
 daemon can run as a client of syslogd or optionally as a standalone
 program.  Klogd can now be used to decode EIP addresses if it can
 determine a System.map file.

 loader; once the operating system is installed I recommend LILO as the
 boot loader, except for people whose root filesystem is a UMSDOS
 filesystem (where a DOS defragmenter could wreck havoc with LILO's
 carefully set up block tables) -- for them I recommend Loadlin (which
 loads Linux from the DOS command line).

Description: Compatibility package for termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program fails to run with the following error message
  "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'"
 or complains about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necesary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 9.13.15

 The object of the game is to lift the green blob (what is it, really?)
 from the floor of the cave and up to the surface. The blob is very heavy
 (compared to the ship) and this makes it tougher than it may seem. The fact
 that the connection between the blob and the ship is always of the same
 length also adds to the complexity. It is very easy to just spin around
 the mass center as soon as the ship and the blob are connected.
 .

Description: The GNU time utility.
 The `time' command runs another program, then displays information
 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system while
 the program was running.  You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have `time' save the information
 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that `time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

 This is an X windows interface to mail built using Tcl/Tk.
 Reading, sending, and managing mail messages can almost all be done
 using only the mouse (except for the body of the message, of course).
 TkMail writes its folders in the format of the standard unix 'Mail'
 command. It also uses 'sendmail' commands to do the mail delivery
 work.
 .
  Major Features:
  - listbox interface to messages for easy click and read
  - multiple viewers can be opened on different or the same folder
  - dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders
    for reading, copying, and moving messages
  - button bar for quick composing, replying to, and forwarding of
    mail messages
  - built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail on
    multiple folders
  - easy inclusion of files into message compositions with
    automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired
  - access alternate editor for compositions to send
  - reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt
  - easy piping of message text through unix filters
  - emacs-like key-bindings for text editing
  - emacs-like autosave
  - sorting of messages on any field and the ability to
    write out the folder physically in that order

 see what your printed output will look like. You can choose between a
 black-and-white representation and greyscaling. You can choose an arbitrary
 zoomfactor (at some cost of performance). You can set marks to measure
 distances. You can search for textstrings. You may visit lots of DVIfiles,
 set bookmarks and get them saved to a startup-file.  tmview does not
 support pxl-files. tmview ignores all 'special'-commands and has no

 with tape drives or floppy disks. You could also mount and unmount
 partitions for backups in the pre- and postcommands. tob is a general
 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote
 backups and possibly more.

 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing
 just local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you

Description: V - a C++ GUI Framework.
 V is a portable C++ GUI framework that supports X, Windows 3.1 and Win32
 (suitable for NT and Windows 95).
 .
 It is implemented on top of a widget set such as Athena but the support for
 Motif has also been incorporated.  For this reason, it has the look and feel
 of the native platform or widget set.  This version is based on the Athena
 widget set.  It is also compatible with at least the Athena 3D widget set,
 and possibly other Athena replacement widget sets.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: Melting digital clock
 The xdaliclock program displays a digital clock; when a digit changes,
 it "melts" into its new shape.
 .
 It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and displays the date when a
 mouse button is held down.  It has two large fonts built into it, but
 it can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.  It
 can also do some funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the
 "shape" extension so that the window is shaped like the digits.

Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
         XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
    piece of mail in your mail box.  This lets you know at a
    glance who you have mail from.  XFaces starts out (when you
    have no mail) looking like a color xbiff.  As you receive
    mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images.  Some of XFaces
    features:
 .
      - Both mono and color images.
 .
      - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
      - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
        currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
        SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
      - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
        show up once on your display.  This way, if you receive 30 messages
        from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
      - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
        images and sounds or ignore that mail message compleatly. This
        lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
        mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
        left in your system mailbox.
 .
      - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
        includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
        list.
 .
      - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
      - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
        contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priorty
        item needs your attention.
 .
      - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
        so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
        be used.
 .
      - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
        count, user@host, the contents of any header.

     Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded or
     single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
     All UDP packets can be checked as well as all TCP connections.
     2) Hard reconfiguration:
        a) kills servers for services that are no longer in the
	   configuration file
        b) kills servers that no longer meet the access control criteria
     3) Prevents denial-of-access attacks by
        a) placing limits on the number of servers for each service
	   (avoids process table overflows)
	b) placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
        c) placing limits on the size of log files it creates
     5) Extensive logging abilities:
        a) for every server started it can log:
	  I) the time when the server was started
	  II) the remote host address
          III) who was the remote user (if the other end runs a
	       RFC-931/RFC-1413 server)
	  IV) how long the server was running
	      (I, II and III can be logged for failed attempts too).
        b) for some services, if the access control fails, it can
	   log information about the attempted access (for example,
           it can log the user name and command for the rsh service)
     and more..

Description: Lock X11 display until password is entered.
 xlock locks the X server till the user enters his/her password at the
 keyboard.  While xlock is running, all new server connections are
 refused. The screen saver is disabled. The mouse cursor is turned off.
 The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen. If
 a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
 password of the user who started xlock. xlockmore extends the standard
 xlock program by adding many more modes that are highly configurable.
 .
 Note that under XFree86, the X11 implementation for Linux, Control-
 Alt-Backspace will defeat the locking mechanism and return your
 console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file. 'xdm'
 returns to the login prompt. Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will
 defeat locking mechanism with virtual terminals, so make sure that
 you are not logged onto any virtual consoles.

 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on
 networked computers.  The xntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix
 systems to participate in this synchronization.
 .
 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 syncronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 The NTP protocol supported by xntpd is defined in RFC's 1059, 1119, and
 1305 for versions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  For more information on how
 NTP works, and how to configure a campus of xntpd daemons, load the optional

Description: Automatic screensaver for X
 The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen
 when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended
 monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do
 in the movies.
 .
 The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
 xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
 installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.

Description: Minimal X display lock program
 xtrlock is a very minimal X display lock program, which uses nothing
 except the Xlib library.  It doesn't obscure the screen, it is
 completely idle while the display is locked and you don't type at it,
 and it doesn't do funny things to the X access control lists.

 From the author's README:
 .
 yForth? is a Forth environment written entirely in ANSI C, making it
 extremely portable. The first thing I want to tell you about yForth? is
 that it seems a joke compared to other systems such as gForth or PFE.
 .
 Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in this case you're invited to
 explore yForth?
 .
 It's yours, you can make anything you want with. If you want an explanation
 of the words provided by yForth? please refer to the draft of ANS Forth or
 something equivalent.  The Net will help you.
 .
 Do not expect the prompt "ok" to come up when you run yForth?, the standard
 says that "ok" shall be printed AFTER every succesful command execution...

 exactly as intended.  In general, you should avoid CGMs for this reason.
